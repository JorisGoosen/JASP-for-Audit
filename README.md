# JASP for Audit (JfA)

JASP for Audit **(JfA)** is an officially supported add-on module for JASP (www.jasp-stats.org) that is created for statistical auditing. The module includes procedures and analyses that can be used in daily auditing tasks and eliminates the difficulties that arise from programming statistical analyses and correctly interpreting their results. The module provides a guided workflow for performing a full (Classical or Bayesian) audit. It also features methods for exploring planning, sampling and evaluation in an audit using raw data or summary statistics.

**Note: The required version of JASP (0.9.3) is not released yet, which means that the dynamic module functionality is not supported.**

## How to install JfA

To install JfA in the base version of JASP, simply click the + icon on the right side and go to "Add Dynamic Module".

You now have access to all that JfA has to offer, including methods to plan, perform and evaluate an audit. Click one of the icons in the tabbar to select an analysis. JfA provides the auditor with a workflow for performing the full statistical process of substantive testing.
