# JASP for Audit (JfA)

JASP for Audit **(JfA)** is an officially supported add-on module for JASP (www.jasp-stats.org, version 0.10.0 or higher) that is developed for statistical auditing. The module includes procedures and analyses that can be used in daily auditing tasks and eliminates the difficulties that arise from programming statistical analyses and correctly interpreting their results. The module features a guided workflow for performing (frequentist or Bayesian) substantive testing in an audit. It also features methods for planning an audit sample without requiring access to data.
