The use of explanatory text
==========================

Turning on the explanatory text will provide you with an explanation of each step in the estimation process. This will help you understand what the practical interpretation of your choices is, and helps you report your findings to others. With explanatory text enabled each table will have its own caption. Figures always have captions enabled.
